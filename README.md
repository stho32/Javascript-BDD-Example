# JavaScript BDD Example

This repository is an example of the things presented in the named course.
Its about mocha, chai, setting up unit tests, different types of unit tests, and finally adding travis ci and coverage on github.

course: 
  - https://teamtreehouse.com/library/javascript-unit-testing/introducing-unit-testing/introduction

links: 
  - http://www.chaijs.com/api/bdd/
  - https://mochajs.org/
  - http://sinonjs.org/ (has been recommended as something to read for mocks, stubs and spies)
  


After the main course is done I may extend them in the following way:
  - [ ] add https://coveralls.io / travis ci for continuous testing
